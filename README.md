# carolinemarcks.dev

Welcome to the source code for my personal website, [carolinemarcks.dev](https://carolinemarcks.dev).

Because I spend most of my time behind the scenes and not producing or consuming web apis myself, this site was built as a personal challenge to learn some technologies that I'm interested in. It is built with React and Typescript, and some components are powered by a GraphQL API. The infrastructure is all managed through AWS via CloudFormation.

The theme is based on [HTML5 UP's strata theme](https://html5up.net/strata).
